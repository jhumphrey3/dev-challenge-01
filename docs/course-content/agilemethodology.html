<h4>What is Agile Methodology?</h4>
<p>As quoted from Wikipedia, Agile methodology is defined as..."In software development, agile practices involve discovering requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer/end user.".<br>

</p><br>
<h4>Why is Agile important?</h4><br>
<p>
Agile lets a team of developers work and implement changes rapidly without the chance of a total failure. Agile is focused around feedback and adapting to change. Agile is iterative, which means that it is built onto piece by piece.

<h4>Agile Manifesto</h4>
<p>These are the core principals that Agile methodology was built around</p><hr>
<ul>
	<li>Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software. </li>
<li>Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage. </li>
<li>Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
<li>Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project. </li>
<li>Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done. </li>
<li>The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
<li> Working software is the primary measure of progress. </li>
<li>Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. </li>
<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility. </li>
<li>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams. </li>
<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly. </li>
</ul>
